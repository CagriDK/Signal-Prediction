There are two files provided together with this homework “train_data.xlsx” and “test_data.xlsx”. These files contain representative BLE beacon measurements. 
There are two columns in both files where the first column is distance and the second column is the corresponding signal strength. 
Each row is the measured distance for different signal strength values.  

-The number of rows in “train_data.xlsx” is 115. This is the training set. 
-The number of rows in “test_data.xlsx” is 20. This is the test set. 

ConsiderİNG the problem of associating the signal strength with the distance. 
In such a problem, distance value may be taken as a feature to model the value of signal strength. 
Therefore we will take the “distance” column as the single feature and “signal strength” as the target value.
